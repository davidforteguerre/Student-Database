# Student-Database
This repository contains a student database that I designed and implemented from beginning to end using Microsoft SQL server.

When I created this project, I was a French instructor at Syracuse University. Please see the project report for more background and the SQL code for the database implementation.

Note that all the student data that was in the original project was removed before being uploaded to GitHub. Student data is highly confidential.
